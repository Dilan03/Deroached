# **Deroached** *(A Stealth Game)*

In *Deroached*, players must escape an asylum by sneaking past or eliminating enemies. Use stealth and strategy to reach your goal without getting caught.

## **Technologies**
- **Game Engine**: Made with GameMaker Language (GML) in GameMaker
- **Art Assets**: Created with Aseprite

## **Challenges**
*Deroached* is the most challenging project Iâ€™ve ever undertaken. Initially, I chose GameMaker over Unity because learning Unity would have taken significantly more time. However, I had no prior knowledge of GameMaker, so I had to learn everything from scratch. This project pushed me to my limits in both learning and development.
