## **Challenges**
*Deroached* is the most challenging project I’ve ever undertaken. Initially, I chose GameMaker over Unity because learning Unity would have taken significantly more time. However, I had no prior knowledge of GameMaker, so I had to learn everything from scratch. This project pushed me to my limits in both learning and development.
